# About
This is an online manga reader built in Rust using Web Assembly (Yew).

# Features
- [ ] 

In 2010, I began a site called innerbleach.com (Which is now deceased). 

I built a manga reader that made the reading experience unique and pleasant. I also believed it was one of its kind, as it allowed you to:

- [ ] View thumbnails in a carousel format while you were reading
- [ ] Prefetch the pages while you were reading.
- [ ] No loading between pages.
- [ ] It allowed you to view the manga side by side, creating a true reading experience.
- [ ] It allowed you to save your progress and come back to where you left.
- [ ] It contained a "turn off the lights", to make the background dim.
- [ ] It allowed you to automatically control the manga page by changing its width, and height to match your screen (so you could read it from a far), or very close.
- [ ] It had cinema mode. Allowing you to read it from a TV, and automatically scroll by a fixed timer. 
- [ ] It had a gallery mode. It showcased you the ability to view small thumbnails 
- [ ] It had playlist mode. You could mash up One Piece, Bleach, Fairy Tail and Naruto into one batch reading (And supported all the features mentioned above)
- [ ] You could customize the color of the buttons.

- The build.rs file is used to read the files from a directory and return it in a concrete rust file that will be used by yew to extract it.
